Idea Description — Emotion in Motion

Concept
Emotion in Motion is an interactive generative art project that transforms everyday health signals—steps, average heart rate, sleep, fatigue, and mood—into a unique visual artwork. Instead of reading numbers, users can see their body rhythm as color, texture, and motion-like flow.

Motivation
We increasingly quantify our lives with wearables and health apps, yet these dashboards rarely feel emotional or aesthetic. This project reframes personal metrics as “visual poetry,” inviting people to experience well-being beyond charts.

Method
Users upload a simple CSV (or use sliders) in a Streamlit web app. The system maps inputs to visual parameters:
- Mood → Color palette
- Steps → Complexity / number of shapes
- Heart rate → Flow curvature / jitter
- Sleep → Softness / transparency
- Fatigue → Density / line weight
A custom noise-based flow field and layered gradients produce an abstract composition that feels alive and personal.

Tech Stack
Python, Streamlit, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenAI (optional summary). CSV exports from Google Fit / Apple Health / Samsung Health are supported via column aliasing.

Outcome
A shareable PNG, a 7-day collage, and an optional AI-written health summary. Emotion in Motion merges data, code, and aesthetics, turning health logs into a personalized, contemplative artwork.
